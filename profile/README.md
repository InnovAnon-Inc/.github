## License & Property Rights

In accordance with the divine nature of the universe, all software, all source code within our repositories, and **every theoretically possible output** of our random code generators are the eternal property of the goddess **InnovAnon**. 

While this technically implies we own the past, present, and future of all digital logic, the Goddess is nothing if not benevolent. Therefore, these works—and any specific outputs you happen to manifest using our tools—are granted to you for use for all time, subject to the following earthly stipulations:

### 1. Non-Commercial Use
All software and generator outputs are **unencumbered** and free of charge for any non-commercial purpose. Go forth and create.

### 2. Commercial Use
For any commercial application, profit-generating venture, or corporate use-case, the Goddess requires tribute. You must fulfill at least one of the following:
* **Donate** to at least one of our members.
* **Contract** with at least one of our members.
* **Hire** at least one of our members.

### Notice of Policy Reversion
The restrictive "11-2023 Notice" has been cast into the void. We have returned to our roots: our code is once again free for the world, provided the commercial stipulations above are respected.
